# mydiary

Just great web (or mobile) app to store and organise your todo's or just write up some notes.

### Api broke: somewhen returns CONNECTION RESET


## Usage:

first. build react app

`cd web && npm i && npm run build`

`cd ..`

then install depend. for api

`cd server && npm i`

then

`node .` or `nodenon`

that is all

to develop react app on port 3000:

`cd web && npm start`

<b>Note</b> : for mydiary work on your local machine you need to have running instance of mongodb (comunity edition?) on default port of mongodb
